# Ensemble learning
* Ensemble learning is a machine learning technique that enhances accuracy and resilience in forecasting by merging predictions from multiple models.
* It aims to mitigate errors or biases that may exist in individual models by leveraging the collective intelligence of the ensemble.

The underlying concept behind ensemble learning is to combine the outputs of diverse models to create a more precise prediction. By considering multiple perspectives and utilizing the strengths of different models, ensemble learning improves the overall performance of the learning system. This approach not only enhances accuracy but also provides resilience against uncertainties in the data. By effectively merging predictions from multiple models, ensemble learning has proven to be a powerful tool in various domains, offering more robust and reliable forecasts.
