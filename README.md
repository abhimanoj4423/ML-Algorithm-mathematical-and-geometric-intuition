# Ensemble learning
* Ensemble learning is a machine learning technique that enhances accuracy and resilience in forecasting by merging predictions from multiple models.
* It aims to mitigate errors or biases that may exist in individual models by leveraging the collective intelligence of the ensemble.

The underlying concept behind ensemble learning is to combine the outputs of diverse models to create a more precise prediction. By considering multiple perspectives and utilizing the strengths of different models, ensemble learning improves the overall performance of the learning system. This approach not only enhances accuracy but also provides resilience against uncertainties in the data. By effectively merging predictions from multiple models, ensemble learning has proven to be a powerful tool in various domains, offering more robust and reliable forecasts.

# Supervised Learning
* Supervised learning is a category of machine learning that uses labeled datasets to train algorithms to predict outcomes and recognize patterns. 
* Unlike unsupervised learning, supervised learning algorithms are given labeled training to learn the relationship between the input and the outputs. 
* Are widely used across various industries and fields, including healthcare, marketing, financial services, and more. 

The data used in supervised learning is labeled â€” meaning that it contains examples of both inputs (called features) and correct outputs (labels). The algorithms analyze a large dataset of these training pairs to infer what a desired output value would be when asked to make a prediction on new data. Once the model has been trained and tested, you can use it to make predictions on unknown data based on the previous knowledge it has learned.

# Unsupervised learning
* Unsupervised learning in artificial intelligence is a type of machine learning that learns from data without human supervision.
* Unlike supervised learning, unsupervised machine learning models are given unlabeled data and allowed to discover patterns and insights without any explicit guidance or instruction.

Unsupervised learning algorithms are better suited for more complex processing tasks, such as organizing large datasets into clusters. They are useful for identifying previously undetected patterns in data and can help identify features useful for categorizing data.
