# Unsupervised learning

## Clustering
Clustering is a technique for exploring raw, unlabeled data and breaking it down into groups (or clusters) based on similarities or differences. It is used in a variety of applications, including customer segmentation, fraud detection, and image analysis. Clustering algorithms split data into natural groups by finding similar structures or patterns in uncategorized data. 

## Dimensionality reduction
Dimensionality reduction is an unsupervised learning technique that reduces the number of features, or dimensions, in a dataset. More data is generally better for machine learning, but it can also make it more challenging to visualize the data. Dimensionality reduction extracts important features from the dataset, reducing the number of irrelevant or random features present. This method uses principle component analysis (PCA) and singular value decomposition (SVD) algorithms to reduce the number of data inputs without compromising the integrity of the properties in the original data.
